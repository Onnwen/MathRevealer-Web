# MathRevealer  - A Powerful Tool for Revealing the World of Mathematics

Welcome to the MathRevealer repository! This project was born during our senior year of high school with the aim of literally revealing the world of mathematics. Thanks to powerful algorithms entirely developed from scratch, MathRevealer is able to obtain various information about the functions entered by the user, including: domain, sign, limits, graph, and much more.

MathRevealer is designed to be a real  study tool  for high school students, providing useful and detailed information on every function. Moreover, thanks to an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, MathRevealer aims to be a valuable aid for those who have difficulties in mathematics: created for those who have difficulties, by those who have difficulties.

## Features
